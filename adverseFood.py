CAERS is a post-market surveillance system that collects reports about adverse events involving CFSAN-regulated products. 
Their database receives both mandatory reports for dietary supplements as well as voluntary reports from both consumers 
and health care practitioners through MedWatch, emails, telephone calls, faxes, letters, and electronic transfers from the 
Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) District Officesâ€™ Field Accomplishments and Compliance Tracking System (FACTS).
